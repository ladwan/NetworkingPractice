        Green mat for avilible tageting looked a bit odd, maybe update this to look better 
        add the other 5 abilites
        and potentialy add the passive abilities as well
        individual chars will likely need custom ui to help players understand their mechanics better, make a holder object to store these ui's when they are spawned in dynamically
