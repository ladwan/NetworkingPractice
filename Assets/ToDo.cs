        Occasionally the charather selection screen will throw a null ref
        Green mat for availible targeting looked a bit odd, maybe update this to look better 
        Add the other 5 abilites
            add the passive abilities as well
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DO TODAY:

        1) Start working on the ult for the speedster

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Make status effect middle man
     Meaning, make a class generic enough to handle all the base functionality EVERY status effect will have
       Spawning in a ui, formatting that ui for the display manager, updating durations etc
    
    Define what a status effect is
        is that better served by an interface or abstract class?

    Char Abilty > Status Effect > Momentum needs to be the inheiritence chain
    Status effect needs to be the layer that holds all of the logic for the status effect display manager

    Continue refctoring  Status Effect logic , genericize momentum logic
