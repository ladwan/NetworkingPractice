        TODO: Start implementing the new click and drag movement system
            
            a) look over drag movement code to reduce bugs
                    make sure when turn ends from timing out drag mover is reset and connections auras are turned off ***
                        also make sure this works when you hit the back button ***
                    make it so you can only click the drag mover once you click move and the camera anmation is done ***
                           also make sure to turn the drag move off when ending a turn (test the edge case of what happens when you are still dragging when the turn ends) ***
                           also make sure to re-disable it when you hit the back or confirm buttons ***
                    make sure drag mover is fully functional on player 2 
                    removed unused ui buttons and old code for movement system
