     * 2 Ap = 5 points of damage
     * 
        If status effect 1 ends before status effect 2, slide that status effect back to the first open slot
        Occasionally the charather selection screen will throw a null ref
        Green mat for availible targeting looked a bit odd, maybe update this to look better 
        Add the other 5 abilites
            add the passive abilities as well
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DO TODAY:

      Test game and refactor code
      Look for edge cases 

    6/16/24
    rename test anim controller to something more meaningful

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maybe dont need toggle because ui blockers can clean themselves up
    Make class that holds and displays ability descriptions


    Read from packet to make sure the data is as expected // Do this both server side and client side
