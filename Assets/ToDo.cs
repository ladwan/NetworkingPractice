        If status effect 1 ends before status effect 2, slide that status effect back to the first open slot
        Occasionally the charather selection screen will throw a null ref
        Green mat for availible targeting looked a bit odd, maybe update this to look better 
        Add the other 5 abilites
            add the passive abilities as well
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DO TODAY:

      Test game and refactor code
      Look for edge cases 

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We need to make a class that takes in an int and out a formatted status effect
     
    finish the networking of the status effect data 

    Start debugging the refactoring you were doing on line 54 in StatusEffectStaticManager
