    /*
     * 2 Ap = 5 points of damage
     * 
        If status effect 1 ends before status effect 2, slide that status effect back to the first open slot
        Occasionally the charather selection screen will throw a null ref
        Green mat for availible targeting looked a bit odd, maybe update this to look better

    DO TODAY:

    Keep learning shader stuff!

    poiyomi and liltoon

     Named variables : Study this

        go to client handle and shake camera when anim comes in

        continue implementing charather specific cameras



      Test game and refactor code
      Look for edge cases 
      
    speedster quick punch momentum aminations
    1-14 / base anim
    15-24 / Stronger punch anim
    25+ / Ultimate punch anim
        if you are animating then the clock will always stop & if you are animating hide interactable buttons 

    only enable confirm button on move screen if the users move at least 1 sq
    only do long speedster anim if you move at least 3 sqs

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maybe dont need toggle because ui blockers can clean themselves up
    Make class that holds and displays ability descriptions


    Read from packet to make sure the data is as expected // Do this both server side and client side
